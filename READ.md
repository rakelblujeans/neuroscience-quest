Neuroscience is the first Android app I wrote at Amplify. I wrote it in a week with no prior Android experience. We tend to focus more on rapid iteration over high quality finished products, as we are still heavily focused on prototyping ideas with local school kids. The neuroscience app is an audio and visual experience that illustrates some of the neurological experiences covered in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Mistook-His-Wife/dp/0684853949">The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</a>. Kids are encouraged to walk around the classroom during the experience and interact with each other, exploring how a disease affects their perception.
